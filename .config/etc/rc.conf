# LOGGING CONFIGURATION
##############################################################################

# rc_logger launches a logging daemon to log the entire rc process.
# When set to "YES", OpenRC will capture all service startup/shutdown output
# that usually flashes by on the console and save it to a persistent log file.
# This is invaluable for debugging services that fail during the boot process.
rc_logger="YES"

# Through rc_log_path you specify the location of the log file generated by rc_logger.
# The default is /var/log/rc.log. Ensure the directory is writable by the root user.
rc_log_path="/var/log/rc.log"


##############################################################################
# SYSTEM & SUBSYSTEM SETTINGS
##############################################################################
# rc_sys defines the virtualization or container environment the system is in.
# An empty string "" triggers automatic detection.
# Explicitly setting this (e.g., to "docker", "lxc", or "xenU") can prevent 
# services from attempting to perform hardware tasks that aren't allowed 
# in those specific environments. prefix
rc_sys="prefix"

# rc_tty_number defines the number of TTYs (Virtual Terminals) allocated for logins.
# This value is used by internal scripts like consolefont and keymaps to 
# apply settings across the specified range of terminals.
rc_tty_number=12


##############################################################################
# SUPERVISE DAEMON (SELF-HEALING)
##############################################################################
# These settings provide global defaults for services managed by supervise-daemon.
# Supervise-daemon monitors services and automatically restarts them if they crash.

# respawn_delay is the cooldown period (in seconds) to wait after a service 
# crashes before attempting to restart it. 
# A delay of 2 seconds prevents rapid "thundering herd" restart loops.
respawn_delay=2

# respawn_max sets the threshold for failure. It is the maximum number of 
# restart attempts allowed within the 'respawn_period'.
# 0 means unlimited attempts. Setting this to 5 provides a safety net against 
# services that crash repeatedly due to permanent configuration errors.
respawn_max=5

# respawn_period sets the window of time (in seconds) for the respawn_max limit.
# In this configuration, if a service crashes more than 5 times within 1800 
# seconds (30 minutes), OpenRC will stop trying to restart it and mark it 
# as crashed.
respawn_period=1800
